# Assistant Plugin: Basic User Experience Specification

**Status:** FINAL

[View related GitHub Issue](https://github.com/SorraTheOrc/InnovationEngine/issues/1)

## Introduction

**User Story:**
As a new Headlamp and Kubernetes user, I want to use a Headlamp plugin that presents a user interface within Headlamp to author Executable Documents with the help of GitHub Copilot, so that I can build and manage my application on a local Kubernetes cluster without leaving the Headlamp environment.

This specification defines the minimum user experience for the Assistant Headlamp plugin. The output of this work is a Headlamp plugin that enables new users to interact with GitHub Copilot for authoring Executable Documents and managing local Kubernetes clusters, all from within the Headlamp UI.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The output must be a Headlamp plugin that integrates directly into the Headlamp UI.
- The plugin must provide a user interface within Headlamp for interacting with GitHub Copilot.
- Users must be able to enter natural language queries or requests (e.g., "Create a deployment for my app").
- The plugin must enable users to author Executable Documents with Copilot's assistance, suitable for use in Innovation Engine.
- The plugin must display Copilot's responses, including code snippets, explanations, and step-by-step instructions.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The UI must be simple, clear, and accessible to Kubernetes beginners.
- All interactions must occur within the Headlamp UI (no external browser windows or command shells required for core flows).
- The plugin must not require cluster admin privileges for basic usage.
- The plugin must not store user queries or responses beyond the current session.

## Design

### Architecture
- The plugin will be a frontend-only Headlamp plugin (initially), using the Headlamp plugin API and React.
- The UI will consist of:
  - An "Assistant" sidebar entry.
  - A main panel with:
    - A text input for user queries.
    - A display area for Copilot responses.
    - Action buttons for copying code, running suggested commands, or opening documentation.
    - Quick start links for common tasks.

### Components & Interfaces
- Sidebar entry: "Assistant"
- Main panel: React component(s) for chat, response display, and quick actions

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- UI components render and update correctly
- User input is accepted and displayed
- Copilot responses are rendered as expected

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end flow: user enters a query, receives a response, and can copy/use the result
- Quick start actions trigger the correct flows

### Acceptance Criteria
- A new user can open the Assistant panel, ask a question, and receive a helpful response from Copilot
- The user can copy code or commands from the response
- The user can access quick start actions for common Kubernetes tasks
