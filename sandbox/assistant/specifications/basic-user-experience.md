# Assistant Plugin: Basic User Experience Specification

**Status:** Draft

## Introduction

**User Story:**
As a new Headlamp and Kubernetes user I want to be able to ask GitHub Copilot to help me build and manage my application on a local Kubernetes cluster.

This specification defines the minimum user experience for the Assistant Headlamp plugin, focusing on enabling new users to interact with GitHub Copilot for local Kubernetes cluster creation and management.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The plugin must provide a user interface within Headlamp for interacting with GitHub Copilot.
- Users must be able to enter natural language queries or requests (e.g., "Create a deployment for my app").
- The assistant will generate guidance in the form of an Executable Document for use in Innovation Engine.
- The plugin must display Copilot's responses, including code snippets, explanations, and step-by-step instructions.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The UI must be simple, clear, and accessible to Kubernetes beginners.
- All interactions must occur within the Headlamp UI (no external browser windows oe command shells required for core flows).
- The plugin must not require cluster admin privileges for basic usage.
- The plugin must not store user queries or responses beyond the current session.

## Design

### Architecture
- The plugin will be a frontend-only Headlamp plugin (initially), using the Headlamp plugin API and React.
- Communication with GitHub Copilot will be via a backend service or API (to be defined in future specs).
- The UI will consist of:
  - An "Assistant" sidebar entry.
  - A main panel with:
    - A text input for user queries.
    - A display area for Copilot responses.
    - Action buttons for copying code, running suggested commands, or opening documentation.
    - Quick start links for common tasks.

### Components & Interfaces
- Sidebar entry: "Assistant"
- Main panel: React component(s) for chat, response display, and quick actions
- (Future) API interface for Copilot integration

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- UI components render and update correctly
- User input is accepted and displayed
- Copilot responses are rendered as expected

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end flow: user enters a query, receives a response, and can copy/use the result
- Quick start actions trigger the correct flows

### Acceptance Criteria
- A new user can open the Assistant panel, ask a question, and receive a helpful response from Copilot
- The user can copy code or commands from the response
- The user can access quick start actions for common Kubernetes tasks
