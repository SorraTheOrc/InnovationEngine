## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and kubectl configured.

## Step 3: Verify the Deployment

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
kubectl get pods -l app=hello-app
```

## Step 4: Test the Application

```bash
# Get the external IP (may take a few minutes)
kubectl get service hello-app --watch
```

## Clean Up

```bash
kubectl delete service hello-app
kubectl delete deployment hello-app
```
